# Speech-to-Text
A Offline/Online Tool for converting voice to text (Supports English &amp; Persian)

You can browse o record files and get the text as the output.

- Note that the offline mode uses Vosk models. The /models folder is not included, so the program will throw an error for not finding the models. Visit https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models for downloading them. The versions that are used are: "vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15" and "vosk-model-small-fa-0.42"
